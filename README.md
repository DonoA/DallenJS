# DallenJS
Dallen's Landing node.js website

A website for tracking and displaying projects I have built over the years. The website has three key features:

### Authentication
The website allows users to login through Google. If a user is an administrator, they are allowed to create, update, and destroy project pages and archives

### Projects
The website is designed to allow maximum configurability once deployed. An administrator can create top level navigation dropdowns and add new projects easily. In addition, the site can import markdown files and render then in place of a project description.

### Archives
This portion of the site is designed for users to upload ast projects that may not have publicly hosted source control. The descriptions can also contain markdown from a specified readme file elsewhere on the web.
